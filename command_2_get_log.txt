Commands to get running logs:
==================================

1. Tail command is used to see the running logs.


In the first example the command tail needs the -f argument to follow the content of a file.

-   $ sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

The second version of the command is actually a command itself: tailf. 
You won’t need to use the -f switch because the command is built-in with the -f argument

-   $ sudo tailf /var/log/apache2/access.log


The tail -F will keep track if new log file being created and will start following the new 
file instead of the old file.


-   $ sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log

However, by default, tail command will display the last 10 lines of a file.
For instance, if you want to watch in real time only 
the last two lines of the log file, use the -n file combined with the -f flag, as shown in the below example.

-   $  sudo tail -n2 -f /var/log/apache2/access.log



2. Multitail Command – Monitor Multiple Log Files in Real Time


$ sudo yum install multitail

To display the output of two log file simultaneous, execute the command as shown in the below example.

-- $ sudo multitail /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log

3. lnav Command – Monitor Multiple Log Files in Real Time

  To install lnav utility in Debian and RedHat based Linux distributions by issuing the below command.

$ sudo yum install lnav

Watch the content of two log files simultaneously by issuing the command as shown in the below example

--$ sudo lnav /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log



4. less Command – Display Real Time Output of Log Files


As with tail utility, pressing Shift+F in a opened file in less will start following the end of the file. 
Alternatively, you can also start less with less +F flag to enter to live watching of the file.

--$ sudo less +F  /var/log/apache2/access.log

# wget http://crunchtools.com/wp-content/files/petit/petit-current.rpm
# rpm -i petit-current.rpm


Hashing a Log File
----------------------

This is a straightforward petit function – it sums up the number of lines discovered in a log file. 
It’s output comprises of the number of similar lines found in the log and what the group broadly 
looked like as shown below.

# petit --hash /var/log/yum.log  or  # petit --hash --fingerprint /var/log/messages


Finding Number Of Lines Produced by a Daemon

# petit --hash --daemon /var/log/syslog


Finding Number Of Lines Produced by a Host

# petit --host /var/log/syslog

Performing a Word Count in a Log File

# petit --wordcount /var/log/syslog

Graphing a Log File

This works in a key/value bar charting format, for side by side comparison of distributions 
as shown in the examples below.
To graph the first 60 seconds in a syslog,

# petit --sgraph /var/log/syslog

Tracking Particular Words in a Log File

# cat /var/log/messages | grep error | petit --mgraph
