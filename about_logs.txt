1. What are Linux log files

-Log files are a set of records that Linux maintains for the administrators to keep track of i
mportant events. They contain messages about the server, including the kernel,
services and applications running on it.

-Linux provides a centralized repository of log files that can be located under the  /var/log directory.

-The log files generated in a Linux environment can typically be classified into four different categories:

Application Logs
Event Logs
Service Logs
System Logs



apache server logs
--------------------

/var/log/httpd

-error log
-access log

What’s logged here?

-This directory contains the logs recorded by the Apache server.
-Apache server logging information are stored in two different log files – error_log and access_log.

How can I use these logs?:

-The error_log contains messages related to httpd errors such as memory issues 
and other system related errors.

-This is the place where Apache server writes events and error records encountered 
while processing httpd requests.

-If something goes wrong with the Apache webserver, check this log for diagnostic information.

-Besides the error-log file, Apache also maintains a separate list of access_log.

-All access requests received over HTTP are stored in the access_log file.

-Helps you keep track of every page served and every file loaded by Apache.

-Logs the IP address and user ID of all clients that make connection requests to the server.

-Stores information about the status of the access requests, – 
whether a response was sent successfully or the request resulted in a failure.


/var/log/mysqld.log or /var/log/mysql.log

-As the name suggests, this is the MySQL log file.
-All debug, failure and success messages related to 
 the [mysqld] and [mysqld_safe] daemon are logged to this file.
-RedHat, CentOS and Fedora stores MySQL logs 
 under  /var/log/mysqld.log, while Debian and Ubuntu maintains the log in /var/log/mysql.log directory.

How can I use this log?

-Use this log to identify problems while starting, running, or stopping mysqld.
-Get information about client connections to the MySQL data directory
-You can also setup ‘long_query_time’ parameter to log information about query locks and slow running queries.
