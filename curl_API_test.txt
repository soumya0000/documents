-What's curl used for?

curl is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. 
It is also used in cars, television sets, routers, printers,
audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, settop boxes, media players 
and is the internet transfer backbone for thousands of software applications 
affecting billions of humans daily.

- Install Curl on CentOS and Fedora

sudo yum install curl


- How to Use Curl?

curl [options] [URL...]


-if you do not use any option then for example: curl www.google.com

the curl will display the source code of www.google.page homepage in your terminal

If no protocol is specified, curl tries to guess the protocol you want to use, and it will default to HTTP.


-Save the Output to a File

To save the result of the curl command, use either the -o or -O option.
Lowercase -o saves the file with a predefined filename, which in the example below is vue-v2.6.10.js:

curl -o vue-v2.6.10.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js

Uppercase -O saves the file with its original filename:

curl -O https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js

-Download Multiple files

To download multiple files at once, use multiple -O options, followed by the 
URL to the file you want to download.

curl -O http://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/2018.06.01/archlinux-2018.06.01-x86_64.iso  \
     -O https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso


-Resume a Download

You can resume a download by using the -C - option. 
This is useful if your connection drops during the download of a large file, 
and instead of starting the download from scratch, you can continue the previous one.

For example, if you are downloading the Ubuntu 18.04 iso file using the following command:

curl -O http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso

and suddenly your connection drops you can resume the download with:

curl -C - -O http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso
